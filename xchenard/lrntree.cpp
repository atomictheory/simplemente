    This is a new module for learning new openings.
    This file replaces the old file 'learn.cpp'.
    Now, instead of reading the entire tree into memory, we encapsulate
    direct I/O to a binary file which contains the tree.  This saves
    a lot of dynamic memory and prevents us from having to read and write
    the entire tree all at once.

    Revision 1.15  2008/12/10 19:00:31  Don.Cross
    Minor fixes to make Linux g++ warnings go away.

    Revision 1.14  2008/12/07 18:25:53  Don.Cross
    Fixed Linux compile error.

    Revision 1.13  2008/12/01 23:08:53  Don.Cross
    Norm Pollock announced on the WinBoard forum that he has updated his PGN database:
        http://www.open-aurec.com/wbforum/viewtopic.php?t=49522
        http://www.hoflink.com/~npollock/chess.html
    This is just what I was looking for, so that I could beef up chenard.trx (training file).
    I modified the PGN scanner to recognize WhiteElo, BlackElo, and Result tags.
    I am using WhiteElo and BlackElo to decide whether a game is trustworthy enough to pretend like Chenard thought
    of the move itself, so that it will play that move in actual games, instead of just as a reference point for opponent moves.
    I am currently in the process of slurping an enormous amount of openings into chenard.trx.
    I decided to move GetNextPgnMove from board.cpp to gamefile.cpp, where it really belongs.

    Revision 1.12  2008/11/24 11:21:58  Don.Cross
    Fixed a bug in ChessBoard copy constructor where initialFen was not initialized to NULL,
    causing ReplaceString to free invalid memory!
    Now tree trainer can absorb multiple games from one or more PGN files (not just GAM files like before).
    Made a fix in GetNextPgnMove: now we have a new state PGN_FILE_STATE_GAMEOVER, so that loading
    multiple games from a single PGN file is possible: before, we could not tell the difference between end of file
    and end of game.
    Overloaded ParseFancyMove so that it can directly return struct Move as an output parameter.
    Found a case where other PGN generators can include unnecessary disambiguators like "Nac3" or "N1c3"
    when "Nc3" was already unambiguous.  This caused ParseFancyMove to reject the move as invalid.
    Added recursion in ParseFancyMove to handle this case.
    If ParseFancyMove has to return false (could not parse the move), we now set all output parameters to zero,
    in case the caller forgets to check the return value.

    Revision 1.11  2008/10/27 21:47:07  Don.Cross
    Made fixes to help people build text-only version of Chenard in Linux:
    1. The function 'stricmp' is called 'strcasecmp' in Linux Land.
    2. Found a fossil 'FALSE' that should have been 'false'.
    3. Conditionally remove some relatively unimportant conio.h code that does not translate nicely in the Linux/Unix keyboard model.
    4. Added a script for building using g++ in Linux.

    Revision 1.10  2006/03/20 20:44:10  dcross
    I finally figured out the weird slowness I have been seeing in Chenard accessing
    its experience tree.  It turns out it only happens the first time it accessed the file
    chenard.tre after a reboot.  It was caused by Windows XP thinking chenard.tre was
    an important system file, because of its extension:
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/sr/sr/monitored_file_extensions.asp
    We write 36 bytes to the middle of the file, then close it
    So I have changed the filename from chenard.tre to chenard.trx.
    I also added DEFAULT_CHENARD_TREE_FILENAME in lrntree.h so that I can more
    easily rename this again if need be.

    Revision 1.9  2006/01/26 19:29:36  dcross
    Added check for signal file lrntree.close, so that remote batch file can tell tree
     trainer to exit.

    Revision 1.8  2006/01/18 19:58:12  dcross
    I finally got around to scrubbing out silly cBOOLEAN, cFALSE, and cTRUE.
    Now use C++ standard bool, true, false (none of which existed when I started this project).

    Revision 1.7  2006/01/01 20:06:12  dcross
    Finished getting PGN-to-tree slurper working.

    Revision 1.6  2005/12/28 15:25:05  dcross
    1. Fixed a bug in the experience tree packer:
       I ran into some corruption in chenard.tre, apparently left over from an endianness problem
       from running Chenard on a non-Intel platform.  When the packer found an invalid branch.sibling,
       it would stop everything and lose the rest of the tree.  Now it continues and recovers as much of
       the tree as possible.
    2. Display better debug diagnostics when something is fishy inside the tree.
    3. Minor coding style tweaks.

    Revision 1.5  2005/12/19 03:41:09  dcross
    Now we can safely shut down the trainer.  First press 'p' to pause,
    then enter the command 'q' to quit.  This closes the file and exits cleanly.
    I was worried about pressing Ctrl+Break because chenard.tre is kept open,
    though we do flush the file every time we write to it.  I am concerned about
    corruption in the file that seems to be there.  I want to investigate this some
    time and figure out how to clean out the problems, if any are really there.

    Revision 1.4  2005/12/19 00:44:22  dcross
    Added ability to press 'p' to pause tree trainer after the current position is finished.
    Later, I will either need to fix this to work on Linux, or conditionally comment it out.

    Revision 1.3  2005/11/23 21:30:30  dcross
    Removed all references to intersrv.com, because that ISP no longer exists!
    Changed references to Chenard web site and my email address to cosinekitty.com.
    (Still need to fix cosinekitty.com/chenard.html.)

    Revision 1.2  2005/11/23 21:02:51  dcross
    Because of weird extra '\r' characters, I went ahead and used Visual Slickedit source beautifier.
    Also moved old manual revision history to end of file and added cvs log tag.



        Revision history:
    
    2001 January 12 [Don Cross]
         Adding support for tree file packing... LearnTree::Pack().
    
    2001 January 9 [Don Cross]
         Adding a 'ChessBoard &' parameter to LearnTree::numNodesAtDepth(),
         so that it can tell whether moves are legal or not.  That way it
         can exclude the illegal moves just like the real trainer does.
    
    1999 March 4 [Don Cross]
         Adding code to make sure that moves are legal before being traversed
         in the tree trainer.  This is because I found some illegal moves in
         the main chenard.tre file I have been training for a long time.
         They look like they are really old moves that were caused by an old
         bug.  Also, this change is important because it will ignore nodes
         marked as deleted.  This is accomplished by setting branch.move to
         source=0 and dest=0.
    
    
    1999 February 9 [Don Cross]
         Adding the fields 'nodesEvaluated' and 'numAccesses' to LearnBranch.
         'nodesEvaluated' holds the number of nodes evaluated in the search
         to come up with the move, unless it was a non-computer move, in which
         case it is zero.  'numAccesses' is a counter that is incremented
         every time the computer player retrieves a given move from the 
         experience tree.
         Made the decision on whether to replace an existing node with a new
         node depend on the number of nodes evaluated being greater, but only
         when the old value is greater than zero (for legacy tree entries).
         When the existing value is zero, revert to the old behavior of replacing
         entries based on think time.  This is an attempt to make the tree code
         scale itself based on processor speed.
    
    1999 January 18 [Don Cross]
         New member function LearnTree::absorbGameFile() allows caller
         to add the continuation in a game file to the experience tree.
    
    1999 January 1 [Don Cross]
         Added calls to fflush(stdout) after every printf() call, so that
         output will be seen immediately on operating systems with buffered
         stdout (e.g. Linux).
    
    1998 December 25 [Don Cross]
         Made NodesAtDepthTable bigger, because it looks like I was going
         past the end of the array!  (Maybe this explains mysterious crashes
         in trainer every now and then.)
    
    1996 September 29 [Don Cross]
         Fixed bug in LearnTree::familiarPosition() which allowed ChessRandom
         to be called with an argument of 0.  Now, if total==0, we know that
         there is no move which is good enough to be trusted from experience,
         so we return false, causing the move to be thought about.
    
    1996 September 9 [Don Cross]
         Making LearnTree::trainDepth() call LearnTree::rememberPosition(), so
         as to fix a bug in the former.
         Making rememberPosition() return an integer code indicating whether
         it updated an existing branch or added a new one.
    
    1996 September 8 [Don Cross]
         Fixed a bug in LearnTree::rememberPosition().  It was not writing
         to the tree file when an existing branch was confirmed at a higher
         search time limit.
    
    1996 September 5 [Don Cross]
         Fixed a bug in LearnTree::familiarPosition().  It was using the
         variable 'n' instead of 'numChildren' in the loop where the random
         number 'r' is used to pick the move.
    
    1996 August 22 [Don Cross]
         Started writing this code.
